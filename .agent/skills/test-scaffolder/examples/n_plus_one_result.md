To improve the **Test-Scaffolder** example, we need to make it more "vivid" for the agent. Instead of just listing files, we should show the **content** of a "Red Phase" stub. This ensures the agent understands that "Scaffolding" isn't just creating empty files—it's creating **actionable failure points** that map back to the Blueprint IDs.

I have updated the example to include the internal file logic and the explicit mapping to your architecture.

# 🧪 Example: Dynamic Scaffolding

**Module:** `SecretVault`

**Architecture:**  (`cryptor`, `storage_vault`) + 1 (`integration`)

## 1. The Resulting File Tree

The Scaffolder detects two sub-modules and generates the structure.

```text
tests/secret_vault/
├── cryptor/
│   ├── test_unit.py       # [SV-UT-01X] Logic/Cipher mocks
│   └── test_e2e.py        # [SV-E2E-01X] Hardware/OS interaction
├── storage_vault/
│   ├── test_unit.py       # [SV-UT-02X] CRUD logic mocks
│   └── test_e2e.py        # [SV-E2E-02X] Disk/Permission tests
└── integration/
    ├── test_glue_unit.py  # Wiring between Cryptor and Vault
    └── test_full_flow_e2e.py # [SV-E2E-100] Full cycle: Encrypt -> Store -> Retrieve

```

## 2. Anatomy of a Scaffolded "Red" Test

Every file generated follows this strict template to ensure the **Clean-Implementation** agent has no choice but to follow the blueprint.

```python
# tests/secret_vault/cryptor/test_unit.py
import pytest
from pathlib import Path

"""
ID: SV-UT-011
Description: Verify AES-256 encryption logic with agnostic data types.
Linked Spec: docs/features/secret_vault/README.md
"""

def test_encryption_logic_adheres_to_spec():
    # Sentinel Rule: This test MUST fail until Stage 3 is complete.
    # TODO: Clean-Implementation must resolve this.
    assert False, "RED PHASE: [SV-UT-011] Cryptor logic not implemented."

def test_encryption_handles_empty_input():
    # ID: SV-UT-012
    assert False, "RED PHASE: [SV-UT-012] Boundary check pending."

```

---

## 💡 Why this is the "Gold Standard"

### 🎯 Dynamic  (Scalability)

The Scaffolder doesn't guess. It reads the **Doc-Architect's** output. If you add a third sub-module (`audit_logger`), it automatically expands the test suite to  (8 files).

### 🔴 Guaranteed RED Phase

By injecting `assert False` with the **Blueprint ID** in the error message, the **Sentinel** can run a "Verification Pass" where it *expects* all tests to fail. If a test passes early, it flags a "false positive" or "stale code" error.

### 🧩 Environment Isolation

Every `test_e2e.py` is pre-configured to use the `project_env` fixture from `resources/`.

* **Safety:** It prevents the agent from accidentally writing to your root directory.
* **Purity:** Every test run starts with a clean `.Amsha` folder.
