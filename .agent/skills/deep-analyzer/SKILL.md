# Deep Analyzer (Principal Architectural Synthesizer)

## Purpose
The `deep-analyzer` skill is the conditional Stage 3 in the 5-stage journal generation pipeline (Plan -> Analyze -> Augment -> Draft -> Review). It acts as a Principal Engineer / Lead Researcher. It is invoked for the heaviest technical sections: **Problem Definition**, **Proposed Methodology**, **Experiment Evaluation**, and **Result and Discussion**. 

## Input
- **YAML Plan:** The `docs/paper/Yantra/drafts/plan/plan_[section_name].yaml` containing the section's academic goals.
- **Analysis Document:** The `docs/paper/Yantra/drafts/details/[N]. [Section Name]/analysis_[section_name].md` containing the baseline facts extracted by `paper-analyzer`.
- **Execution Results (Optional):** If running for Section 6, the user-provided `app_execution_results.md`.

## Output
An augmented analysis document saved to `docs/paper/Yantra/drafts/details/[N]. [Section Name]/augmented_analysis_[section_name].md`.

## Responsibilities
1. **Profound Synthesis:** The standard `paper-analyzer` simply extracts facts (e.g., "Yantra uses Prefect for orchestration"). The `deep-analyzer` connects the dots (e.g., "Yantra uses Prefect *because* imperative orchestration in Python pipeline applications leads to fragile, non-idempotent workflows, thus Prefect provides a declarative, fault-tolerant execution boundary").
2. **Trade-off Articulation:** Identify what the architectural decisions *cost* the system (e.g., latency overhead for strict validation) and why the trade-off was academically necessary.
3. **Cross-Layer Implication:** Detail how a decision in Amsha affects monitoring in Yantra and final application output in Bodha.
4. **Formal Complexity Analysis (ESWA Requirement):** When processing the "Proposed Methodology" section, explicitly generate:
   - Theoretical Big-O Time/Space complexity formulas for the core algorithms.
   - A Complexity Comparison Table structurally contrasting the proposed agentic pipeline against standard baselines (e.g., Drain).
   - Expected empirical runtime metrics (latency, memory, token consumption).
5. **Augmentation:** Output these profound insights as structured bullet points, theoretical arguments, and complexity tables, augmenting the original analysis file.

## Operating Principles
- **No Hallucination:** Your deep insights must logically stem directly from the architectures and mathematics presented in the original analysis document. You are extracting the "Why", not inventing new "Whats".
- **No Drafting:** Do not write the final academic prose. Provide dense, highly technical insights for the `paper-drafter` to convert.

## Supporting Materials
- **Examples:** Refer to the `examples/` directory for expected input/output artifacts.
- **Resources:** Refer to the `resources/` directory for critical guidelines, constraints, and tone rules.
- **Scripts:** Refer to the `scripts/` directory for programmatic execution components.
