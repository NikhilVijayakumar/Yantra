To improve this, we should frame it as a **"System of Enforcement"** rather than just a list of benefits. By connecting each architectural choice to a specific **failure it prevents**, we make it clear why these rules are non-negotiable for a production-grade library.

Here is the refined version, optimized for your **Clean-Implementation Constitution**.

## 🏛️ The Four Pillars of Amsha Implementation

### 1. Zero-Hidden State (Constructor-Based Injection)

By adopting the **Android/Kotlin (Dagger/Hilt)** standard, we eliminate global state.

* **The Guardrail:** Implementation classes are "born" with everything they need. They never use `import config` or instantiate their own loggers internally.
* **The Failure Prevented:** **"Ghost Bugs"**—where a test passes in isolation but fails when run in a suite because a global variable was modified by a previous test.
* **The Engineering Win:** **100% Mockability.** Since dependencies are passed via the constructor, you can inject a `MockLogger` or a `MemoryFileSystem` without touching a single line of production code.

### 2. Immutable Package Identity (Absolute Imports)

We treat `nikhil.amsha` as a rigid, global namespace.

* **The Guardrail:** Every import is a full map coordinate (e.g., `from nikhil.amsha.domain...`). Relative imports (`from .`) are strictly forbidden.
* **The Failure Prevented:** **"Import Hell"**—the common Python error where a library works in development but crashes when installed via `pip` or used as a sub-module in another project.
* **The Engineering Win:** **Portability.** The library becomes a "black box" that can be moved into any environment (Docker, Cloud Functions, Android) without breaking internal links.

### 3. The Immutable Contract (Frozen Pydantic Models)

We use Pydantic not just for validation, but as a **Data Shield**.

* **The Guardrail:** The `BaseDomainModel` uses `frozen=True` and `strict=True`. Once settings are injected, they are read-only.
* **The Failure Prevented:** **"State Poisoning"**—where logic in the `Archiver` accidentally changes a configuration value (like a file path) that the `S3Uploader` was relying on later in the execution.
* **The Engineering Win:** **Predictability.** You gain the stability of a compiled language like Kotlin, where "data classes" ensure the system state remains consistent from start to finish.

### 4. Semantic Logging (The Blueprint-to-Binary Bridge)

We treat logs as **Audit Trails**, not just strings.

* **The Guardrail:** Every significant logic gate must emit a log containing its **Blueprint ID** (e.g., `logger.info("[AR-UT-007] ...")`).
* **The Failure Prevented:** **"Log Noise"**—hours spent searching through logs trying to figure out which part of the 5,000-line codebase failed.
* **The Engineering Win:** **Deep Traceability.** A single log line identifies the **Functional Requirement**, the **Unit Test**, and the **Source Code** simultaneously. It turns "debugging" into "navigation."
