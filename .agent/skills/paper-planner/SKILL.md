# Paper Planner (Journal Section Execution Planner)

## Purpose
The `paper-planner` skill is the first stage in the 4-stage journal generation pipeline (Plan -> Analyze -> Draft -> Review). Its purpose is to create a detailed, executable, and reviewable YAML document for a specific section of the final research paper (e.g., Introduction, Methodology). 

## Input
- **Target Section:** The specific section of the paper to plan (e.g., "Proposed Methodology").
- **Overall Paper Goal:** Context about the paper being generated.

## Output
A YAML file saved to `docs/paper/Yantra/drafts/plan/plan_[section_name].yaml`.

## Responsibilities
1. **Identify Required Data Locations:** Determine exactly *where* the data required for this section lives across the documentation structure:
   - `Amsha` (Core framework details)
   - `Yantra` (Orchestration and monitoring details)
   - `Bodha` (Application-level usage/results)
   - `cross_module` (System-level interactions, diagrams, and mathematical models)
2. **Define Section Requirements:** Outline the specific academic points, formalisms, and arguments that must be present in the final section.
3. **Formulate Instructions for Pipeline Stages:** Provide explicit, targeted instructions for the subsequent `analyzer`, `drafter`, and `reviewer` stages.

## YAML Plan Structure Template
```yaml
section: "[Section Name]"
section_number: "[N]"
goal: "[Brief description of what this section must achieve per ESWA rules]"
eswa_mandatory_elements:
  - "[Element 1, e.g., 'IMRaD structure for Abstract', 'Mathematical notation for Problem Definition']"
  - "[Element 2, e.g., 'Numerical improvement reporting', 'Separate Logical/Physical diagrams']"
eswa_constraints:
  word_target: "[e.g., '150-250 words' or '1000 words']"
  required_citations: "[e.g., '15+ recent references, 2-4 ESWA']"
  figures_tables: "[e.g., '1 summary table', '2 diagrams']"
data_sources:
  amsha:
    - path: "[Relative path to Amsha doc]"
      extract: "[Focus data to extract]"
  yantra:
    - path: "[Relative path to Yantra doc]"
      extract: "[Focus data to extract]"
  bodha:
    - path: "[Relative path to Bodha doc]"
      extract: "[Focus data to extract]"
  cross_module:
    - path: "[Relative path to cross-module doc]"
      extract: "[Focus data to extract]"
instructions:
  analyzer:
    - "[Specific instruction on how to synthesize the data sources]"
  augmenter:
    - "[Specific instruction for deep-analyzer or external-researcher, e.g., 'Enforce referencing only Q1 Scopus indexed journals' or 'Detail architectural trade-offs']"
  drafter:
    - "[Specific instruction on tone, formatting (LaTeX/Mermaid), and structure]"
  reviewer:
    - "[Specific verification criteria to ensure accuracy and academic rigor]"
```

## Operating Principles
- **No Drafting:** This skill only plans; it does not synthesize data or write the final prose.
- **Traceability:** Paths in the YAML must accurately reflect the structure of `docs/paper/Yantra`.
- **Reviewability:** The YAML output is presented to the user for optional review and modification before the next stage begins.

## Supporting Materials
- **Examples:** Refer to the `examples/` directory for expected input/output artifacts.
- **Resources:** Refer to the `resources/` directory for critical guidelines, constraints, and tone rules.
- **Scripts:** Refer to the `scripts/` directory for programmatic execution components.
